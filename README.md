# BIA Curriculum
## Objectives
Each member participating in the Curriculum should graduate with core skills that would be reflected in at least 1 **well-done** project. 
Graduated members would then go on to secure analytics-related internships that are of interest to them, bridging BIA fundamentals with industry experience. After gaining these experiences, they would contribute to the curriculum and help mentor the next-generation of BIA members.

## What is BIA?
### Vision
BIA is a student-organized initiative that is driven to facilitate an accessible co-learning
community aimed towards developing strong competencies in analytics and business intelligence.
### Mission
To help students acquire skills for building solutions for business problems through
student collaboration. At the same time, we strive to ignite passion for Analytics and
leverage opportunities for career development.

## Learning Structure
### What is a Checklist?
A Checklist is a list of resources that readers are meant to read through and understand completely.
A Checklist has its sections split according to importance.
Labels used:
- IMPORTANT
    - Content labelled as IMPORTANT must be completely understood by the reader to proceed on with the curriculum.
- EXTRA
    - Content labelled as EXTRA should be read through at the reader's own leisure, as it will serve to reinforce learnings.
- OPTIONAL
    - Content labelled as OPTIONAL is content that would not affect the reader's comprehension of further material should he/she wish to skip them.

### What is a Notebook?
A Notebook is a Jupyter notebook that is viewed in the Jupyter nbviewer, to walk readers through code usage.
